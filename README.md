Mobile Architecture and Design
App Summary:
The event tracking app was developed to meet users' needs for efficient event management. The primary goals included providing users with the ability to log in, schedule, edit, and delete events. The app aimed to enhance user organization by sending timely reminders and facilitating a seamless event scheduling experience.

UI Design and User-Centered Features:
Screens for user authentication, event creation, editing, and a comprehensive event list were essential to support user needs. The UI designs prioritized simplicity and a straightforward user flow. The success of the designs lies in their intuitive layout, ensuring users can effortlessly manage their events and receive relevant notifications.

Coding Approach:
The coding process involved a structured approach, utilizing Java and Android Studio. Object-oriented principles and design patterns were applied, emphasizing modularity and code readability. The implementation included features like user authentication, event CRUD operations, and integration with notification services.

Testing and Importance:
Comprehensive testing, encompassing unit tests and integration tests, was crucial to verify the functional integrity of the app. Testing played a vital role in identifying and addressing potential issues before deployment, ensuring a positive user experience and minimizing post-launch problems.

Innovation in Overcoming Challenges:
During planning, considerations for the effective use of notifications were a challenge due to the local database storage requirement. An innovative solution was implemented to ensure notifications remained useful by focusing on events actively manipulated, thereby adapting to constraints and improving user engagement.

Demonstrating Knowledge and Skills:
Most of my success and demonstrated knowledge and skills for this project can be found within the UI. Keen understanding of UI principles, as well as inclusion of accessibility made me particularly successful with those portions of the course. I did struggle to get the application to a fully functioning state, but am continuing to improve it until I figure out all errors.
